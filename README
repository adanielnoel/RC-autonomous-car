# Self Driving RC Car #
The aim of this project is to develop an on-board computer vision system for an RC car to make it navigate autonomously in indoor and outdoor environments.

##Version 0.2.6##
Many bug corrections, now the path planning algorithm does not produce any error at all. Also streamlined the simulator interface.

##Version 0.2.5##
Avoidance path planning works! There are still some subtle buggs to correct.

##Version 0.2.4.2##
Major re-write of the avoidance path planning algorithm. Still running tests.

##Version 0.2.4##
Avoidance path planner now generates some circular avoidance paths, but is still under active development.

##Version 0.2.3.9##
Avoidance path planer now detects if going straight is possible

## Version 0.2.3.8 ##
Created an avoidance simulator interface and navigation simulator interface

## Version 0.2.3.5 ##
Improved simulator interface

## Version 0.2.3 ##
Added PathPlaning, Simulator and ObstacleScenario classes. Finnished simulator and started path planing.

## Version 0.2 ##
Many improvements on the StereoCamera and Odometry classes.
**StereoCamera**: added an interactive camera calibration tool and other useful functions.

## Version 0.1.2 ##
Code is now carefully commented and there are lots of command line feedback

## Version 0.1.1 ##
 Added documentation

## Version 0.1 ##
initial skeleton
